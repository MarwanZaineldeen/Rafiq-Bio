0,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"Support in living organisms is a method for supporting the living organisms, keeping its shape and Protecting it, in the following we will study in detail the support in each of plant and human Support in plant: The plant possesses different methods and systems for support to maintain its shape and for its protection, these methods may be First: Physiological support :It is a support that affects the cell itself as a whole, as follows: 1- Water enters the cell sap vacuole by osmosis 2- The size of the cell sap increases and presses on the protoplasm, pushing it outside towards the wall 3- The cell wall extends, due to the increase in pressure acting on it, therefore the cell swells and becomes with a strained wall (cell turgidity), so that it acquires the support"
1,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"the support Remember that: Osmosis : is the passage of water through the semi-permeable membranes(plasma membranes) from a high concentrated medium of water (low concentration of salts) to a low concentrated medium of water (high concentration of salts) High concentration of water molecules is movement of water molecules through semi permeable membrane to low concentration of water molecules Examples:   For losing the physiological support:   1- The shrinking and wilting of leaves and stems of herbaceous plants, on facing soil drought, due to the vanishing of their cells' swelling(turgidity), as a result of their loss of water, therefore the physiological support is vanished 2- The shrinkage and wilting of some fresh seeds, such as beans and peas, on leaving them for a period of time, as their cells lose water, therefore losing the swelling and tension"
2,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"and tension For acquiring the physiological support:   1- The straightening of stems and leaves of herbaceous plants, on irrigating the soil, due to the swelling of their internal tissue cells, as water passes into their sap vacuole by osmosis 2- The swelling(enlargement) of dried fruits and some dried seeds as peas and beans, on soaking them in water for a period of time, due to their absorption of water by osmosis The physiological support is considered a temporary support, as it depends on the filling of the sap vacuole of plant cell with water, and on losing this water, the support is weakened or vanished From the previous, we can define the physiological support, as follows:   Physiological support: It is a temporary support that affects the cell itself as a whole through the entry of water into it by osmosis till reaching its sap vacuole, therefore it swells and becomes with strained wall, so that the plant acquires a support"
3,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"acquires a support Key Points:   Parenchyma tissue:   - It consists of living cells, where each one of them contains one sap vacuole (large) or more and a thin pitted wall consisting of cellulose substance that is permeable to water - It provides the plant with a temporary physiological support The physiological support in plant is affected by several vital processes, such as : (Absorption process, photosynthesis process and transpiration process) - As the rate of photosynthesis increases, the process of water and salts absorption from the soil increases, therefore the amount of water lost by transpiration process increases, then the plant will compensate the lost water by absorbing water from the soil, which increases the physiological support - The carbohydrates (sugars) that result from the photosynthesis process increase the concentration of cell sap in the sap vacuoles, leading to the transfer of water towards them by osmosis and increase the physiological support of cells"
4,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"support of cells Second Structural support:   It is a support that affects the cell wall or parts of it, as follows:   Some rigid strong substances are deposited in the plant cell walls or in some parts of it, to:   - Increase the ability of the plant external cells to protect the plant internal tissues - Prevent the loss of water through them - Provide the cells with turgidity and strength (supporting the plant) Examples:   1- Increasing the thickness of epidermal cell walls(especially the outer cells of them) 2- Plant deposition for water impermeable cutin substance in the epidermal cell walls 3- The plant surrounds itself by a layer of water impermeable cork cells in which suberin substance is deposited 4- Plant deposition for cellulose or lignin substances in the cell walls or parts of them, such as:   collenchyma cells and sclerenchyma cells (such as fibers and stone cells)"
5,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"and stone cells) To provide them with the hardness and strength, as well as the site of presence and spreading of these cells support the plant The structural support is considered a permanent support, because it depends  on the deposition of some substances, such as cellulose, lignin, suberin and cutin in the cell walls or in some parts of them, which supplies them with the hardness and strength, protects the internal plant tissues and prevents the loss of water through them From the previous, we can define the structural support, as follows:   Structural support: It is a permanent support in which some substances, such as cellulose, lignin, cutin and suberin are deposited in the cell walls or in some parts of them, therefore the outer plant cells are responsible for protecting the internal plant tissues and preventing the loss of water through them"
6,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"water through them Comparison between the physiological support and structural support :    Physiological support:   -It depends on the entry of water into the sap vacuoles of the plant cells by osmosis -It is a temporary support, as it depends on the repletion (full) of the cell with water, and when this water is lost, this support is vanished Examples for acquiring the physiological support:   -The swelling of dried fruits, on soaking them in water for a period of time -The straightness of leaves and stems of the herbaceous plants, when watering the soil Examples for losing the physiological support:   -The shrinkage and wilt of some fresh seeds, as peas and bean, on leaving them for a period of time -The wilting of leaves and stems of the herbaceous plants that face the soil drought Structural support:   -It depends on the deposition of some rigid substances, such as cellulose, lignin, cutin and suberin in the plant cell walls or in some parts of them"
7,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"some parts of them -It is a permanent support, as it depends on the deposition of rigid substances in the cell walls or in some parts of them, which supplies them with the hardness and strength, protects the internal plants tissues and prevents the loss of water through them Examples:   -Deposition of cutin substance in the epidermal cell walls -Deposition of cellulose substance in the collenchyma cell walls -Deposition of lignin substance in the inner surface  of sclerenchyma cell walls(fibers and stone cells) -Deposition of suberin substance in the cork cells Key Points:   1- The support varies among the different plant tissues, as follows:   - Physiological (Temporary) support in the cells of parenchyma tissue - Structural (Permanent) support in the cork cells and sclerenchyma cells (fibers and stone cells) - Physiological and structural support together in the leaf epidermal cells and collenchyma cells"
8,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"collenchyma cells 2- Cutin plays a common role between the structural and physiological supports in the plant, where it is deposited in the epidermal cell walls, so that it provides them with a structural support, as well as it prevents the cells from losing water which maintains the physiological support 3- The presence of collenchyma tissue increases in the plant leaves petioles 4- The presence of sclerenchyma tissue increases in the external coat of seeds, such as bean seeds and the hard coat of nuts, as hazelnuts and almonds, in addition, it is present in the tissues of some fruits, as pears 5- The surface of some fruits such as apple and plum is covered by a layer of cutin that is covered by a waxy substance the following illustrates the substances that provide the plant with a structural support:   1- Cellulose:   - Site of its deposition: Cell walls from outside - Tissue supported by it: Collenchyma(living cells) - Its permeability to water: Permeable"

24,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"cells by diffusion - Their sites of presence :   They form some body parts, such as ears, nose and bronchioles of the two lungs They are usually found at the tips of bones, especially at the joints and among the vertebrae of the vertebral column -Their function :   They protect the bones from corrosion, as a result of the continuous friction between them Third Joints:   Joints are classified into three types according to the nature of tissue which is present among bones, which are :   Types of joints:   1- Fibrous joints 3- Synovial joints : according to the range of movement(limited movement joints, Wide movement joints) 1- Fibrous joints: Their properties:   - At these joints the bones are fused with fibrous tissues which change into bony tissues by growing older - Most of them don't allow the movement Example:   The joints that are present among the skull bones and connect them together at their serrated tips"
25,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"their serrated tips 2- Cartilaginous joints: Their properties:   - They connect between the ends of some adjacent bones - Most of them allow a very limited movement Example:   The joints that are found among the vertebrae of the vertebral column 3- Synovial joints: Their properties:   - They represent the majority of body joints - They are flexible and bear shocks (trauma) - They allow the movement easily, because : The bones that are in contact with these joints are covered with a delicate layer of a transparent smooth cartilaginous substance which allows the movement of bones easily with less friction and they contain a synovial fluid which facilitates the sliding of cartilages which cover the tips of bones Their types:   The synovial joints are divided according to the type of movement into:   1- Limited movement joints:    They are the joints that allow the movement of one of the bones in one direction only"
26,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,one direction only 2- Wide movement joints:   They are the joints that allow the movement of bones in different directions Key Point:   The functional suitability of synovial joints:   - Flexible: to bear shocks (trauma) - Contain a synovial fluid: to facilitate the sliding of cartilages covering the tips of bones at the joints - The surface of contacted bones at these joints is covered by a delicate layer of a transparent and smooth cartilaginous substance: to allow the movement of bones easily with less friction - There are ligaments at these joints: to connect the bones together and determine the movement of bones in different directions Fourth Ligaments:   They are separated bundles of a fibrous connective tissue where their tips are me fixed on the two bones of the joint Their properties:   Their fibers are characterized by:   - Being strong and durable
27,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"strong and durable - The presence of a degree of elasticity to allow a little increase in their length in order not to be cut during the exposure of the joint to an external pressure Their functions:   - Link the bones with each other at the joints - Determine the movement of bones at the joints in the different directions Example: The ligaments of knee joint, which are:   - Anterior cruciate ligament In some cases the ligaments may be ruptured due to the occurrence of a twist in some joints as in the cruciate ligament in the knee joint Key Points:   Femur bone is connected to the tibia by three ligaments, which are:   - Anterior cruciate ligament Femur bone is connected to the fibula by the lateral collateral ligament only Fifth Tendons:   They are a strong connective tissue Function:   Link the muscles with bones at the joints, which allow the movement during the contraction and relaxation of muscles"
28,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Support in Living Organisms,"of muscles Its importance:   It connects the gastrocnemius muscle with the heel bone to help in the movement of heel The tearing of Achilles tendon:   - Its Causes:   Performing vigorous effort Sudden contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle Loss of elasticity in the gastrocnemius muscle - Its Symptoms:   Inability of walking - Its treatment:   Using anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs Surgical intervention which is not carried out, except during the complete tearing of the tendon Do you know?   Achilles tendon was named by that name referring to the famous Greek warrior Achilles in an old Greek legend who was hit by an arrow in his heel in the trojan war leading to his fall and death"
29,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"Movement is a phenomenon which characterizes all the living organisms and it is self-generated(spontaneously), as a result of the exposure of the living organism to a stimulus, therefore the living organism may respond positively or negatively to it, and in both cases the response is the occurrence of movement Types of movement in living organisms:   1- Continuous  movement: It occurs inside each cell of the living organism’s cells for the continuity of its vital activities, for example the cytoplasmic streaming movement 2- Positional  movement: It occurs in some parts (organs) of the living organism, for example the peristalsis in the vertebrate’s intestine 3- Total movement:   - By which the living organism moves from a place to another, searching for food, mating or avoiding a danger in its environment - It leads to the spread of the animal in nature, and the more movement means were strong and fast the wider its circle of spread was"
30,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"of spread was Conditions of movement and keeping the balance in animal:   1- The presence of a solid skeleton (support) to which the muscles are attached to enable the animal to move and keep its balance 2- The skeleton must consist of segments that are connected to each other by articulating joints to facilitate the movement Exoskeleton as in the Arthropods such as Shrimp may be Endoskeleton as in the Vertebrates and it may be:   - Cartilaginous as in the Cartilaginous fishes such as Shark and rayfish - Bony as in the Bony fishes such as Bolti and bouri First Movement (Locomotion) in plant:   The types of movement differ in plant according to the type of stimulus, as follows:   Movement in plant:    A- Touch movement: As in Mimosa plant, where its leaflets collapse in a successive order and followed by the rachises, as soon as they are touched, as if they wilt"
31,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"as if they wilt B- Sleeping and awakening movement:   As in Mimosa plant and some legumes, where:   - The leaflets approach each other during darkness which indicates a sleeping movement - The leaflets get away from each other during the daylight which indicates an awakening movement Do you know?   The touch movement affects only the compound leaf (with the leaflets that it carries) that has been touched, while the sleeping and awakening movements affect all the leaves and rachises of the plant C- Tropism: It takes place in all plants, where the different plant parts respond to different stimuli, such as light, humidity and gravity D- Haptotropism (Pulling movement):   - Pulling movement in the tendrils of climbing plants (as in peas):   It occurs by the tendrils and needs a solid support (object) where :   - The tendril raises itself in air to make a contact with a solid object - It immediately twines closely around the solid object and attached firmly to it"
32,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"firmly to it - The rest of the tendril makes a few turns in a spiral form, therefore its length decreases, and so the plant stem approaches towards the support and grows vertically - The tendril becomes thickened after the growing of stem vertically, due to the lay down of a considerable amount of supportive tissues, therefore it becomes stronger Importance of this movement : the growing of the stem vertically Notes:   1- The twining of the tendril around the support is due to:   - The slow growth of the side that is in contact with the support - The accelerated growth of the tendril’s side that is away from the support, therefore it elongates Leading to the twining of the tendril around the support 2- If the tendril doesn't meet a support during its twining movement, it wilts and dies Examples for climbing plants by tendrils: pea and Grapes Key Point:   Movement in plant according to the stimulus:   1- Movement depends on osmosis:   Fast movement - Sleeping and awakening movement"
33,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"awakening movement 2- Movement depends on auxin:   Slow movement - Haptotropism (Pulling movement) 2- Pulling movement in the roots of corms and bulbs (as in Narcissus bulb):   It occurs by the pulling roots, where:   - The corm or bulb roots contract (shrink), therefore the plant is pulled downwards - The corm or bulb is pulled downwards to the normal suitable level in the soil Importance of this movement:   The subterranean storing stem (corm or bulb) always remains at a suitable distance from the soil surface by the help of these pulling roots, which increases its support and protects its aerial parts against the wind effect Examples for subterranean storing stems:   - Green onion (Bulb) Do you know ?   Subterranean storing stems: are stems of some plants that resort to grow under the soil surface to avoid the exposure to the weather effects, such as the low temperatures especially during winter, also they act on storing nutrients inside them, and they can reproduce vegetatively"

48,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"myosin filaments - Huxely used the electron microscope in comparing a muscle fiber at a state of contraction with another fiber at a state of relaxation (rest), and he concluded the following:   At the contraction state:   The protein filaments forming the muscle fibers slide over each other that results in the contraction or shrinkage of the muscle, where:   - Transverse links (formed by the help of calcium ions) are extended from the myosin filaments to reach the actin filaments - The transverse links act as hooks, as in the presence of the energy stored in ATP molecules (the direct store of energy in the muscle), they pull the neighboring groups of actin filaments from both sides towards each other, leading to the muscle fiber contraction Transverse links: They are filaments that are formed by the help of calcium ions and extended from the myosin filaments to reach the actin filaments - During the contraction, the Z-lines approach each other"

55,Support and Movement in Living Organisms,Movement in Living Organisms,"muscle spasm 2- The way of getting rid of the muscle fatigue:   When the muscle stops moving (at rest), this gives it the chance to be supplied by an enough amount of oxygen to perform the aerobic cellular respiration which produces a large amount of ATP molecules that separate the transverse links from the actin filaments, leading to the relaxation of the muscle, therefore the muscle goes again on an alteration of contraction and relaxation once more Remember that: 38 ATP molecules are produced from one glucose molecule, when the muscle respires aerobically, while 2 ATP molecules only are produced, when the muscle respires anaerobically Notes:   - The muscle spasm may occur due to the arrival of incorrect nerve impulses from the brain to the muscles which contradicts their normal performance - The over excessive muscle spasm may lead to the tearing of the muscles, causing a bleeding"

111,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"divides by mitosis 2- The cell (that represents the body of unicellular organism) divides into two cells, where each one of them becomes a new individual B- In unsuitable conditions (in Amoeba):   1- Amoeba secretes a chitinous coat (cyst) around its body for protection 2- It divides within that coat for several times by repeated binary fissions to produce many young Amoebae 3- The young Amoebae are released from the cyst, once the surrounding conditions are improved 2- Budding:   By this form, some living organisms reproduce, such as:   - Yeast (unicellular organism) - Sponges and Hydra (multicellular organisms) Way of its occurrence: it occurs as follows:   A- In unicellular organisms:   - The bud arises as a lateral projection on the original cell - The nucleus divides mitotically into two nuclei, where one of them remains in the mother cell, while the other moves towards the bud"
112,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"towards the bud - The bud grows gradually then it may:   Remain connected with the mother cell till its full growth, then it separates from it Or    Continue its connection with the mother cell, forming cellular colonies with the other growing buds B- In multicellular organisms:   - The bud grows as a small cellular protrusion from one side of the body, due to the division of the interstitial cells and their differentiation into a bud - The bud grows gradually to resemble the mother entirely - The new individual usually separates to start its life independently Note: The sponges and Hydra reproduce sexually besides their ability to reproduce asexually by budding and regeneration also From the previous, we can compare between:   a- Budding in unicellular organisms and Budding in multicellular organisms:   Budding in unicellular organisms:   - The bud arises as a lateral projection on the mother cell"
113,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"on the mother cell - The nucleus divides mitotically into two nuclei, where one of them remains in the mother cell, while the other moves towards the bud - The bud grows gradually till its full growth, then it may separate from the mother cell or continue in its connection with the mother cell, forming cellular colonies Budding in multicellular organisms:   - The bud grows as a small cellular protrusion from one side of the body - The interstitial cells divide mitotically in the living organism and differentiate into a bud - The bud grows gradually to resemble the parent entirely, then it usually separates from the parent to start its life independently b- Binary fission and Budding:   Binary fission:   - It occurs in unicellular living organisms only - The size of resulting individuals (cells) from the division is equal - The parent individual disappears by fission - Examples: Bacteria, Amoeba, Paramecium and Some simple algae"
114,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"Some simple algae Budding:   - It occurs in some unicellular and some multicellular living organisms - The size of resulting individuals (cells) from the division is not equal - The parent individual remains after the occurrence of budding - Examples: Yeast fungus, Hydra and Sponges 3- Regeneration:   This method is common in:   - Many plants - Some worms, such as planarian - Some animals, such as sponges Hydra and sea star (starfish) Regeneration is not considered a reproduction in some organisms, as it is limited on compensating the lost parts of the body, when it is exposed to an accident or a rupture in the tissues The capacity of regeneration decreases by increasing the living organism evolutionary degree (higher animals), as in:   - Some crustaceans and amphibians: regeneration is limited on the compensation of the cut parts only - Higher vertebrates: regeneration never exceeds the healing of wounds, especially if they are restricted in the skin, blood vessels and muscles"
115,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"vessels and muscles Regeneration is considered reproduction in some animals, when the body is cut into several parts, therefore each part of them will grow into a new individual Examples:   - Hydra: It is able to regenerate, if is cut into several transverse pieces, where each part of them will grow into a new individual - planarian worm (from the common freshwater flat worms): It is able to regenerate, if:    It is cut into two longitudinal pieces or it is cut into several transverse pieces Each part of them will grow into a complete independent individual - Sea star (Starfish): If an arm of a sea star is cut with a piece of its central disc:    This arm can regenerate to a fully independent sea star within a short time The cut arm from the original sea star can be compensated by regeneration to be a sea star with its arms completely"
116,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"its arms completely This type of sea stars that feeds on the pearl mussels, can devour about ten mussels daily including the pearl, therefore the breeders of those mussels were collecting the sea stars, tearing them up into pieces, and then throwing them back into the sea Although they tried to get rid of them, they were unintentionally helping in their reproduction, so that they decided to burn them 4- Reproduction by spores (Sporogony):   By this form, the following organisms reproduce:   - Some primitive plants - Many fungi, such as bread would fungus and mushroom - Some algae and ferns, such as polypodies Way of its occurrence: it occurs by single cells called spores that are modified to grow directly into complete individuals Structure of the spore: It is formed of a cytoplasm with a little amount of water, a nucleus and surrounded by a thick coat"
117,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"by a thick coat Spore: It is a single cell that is modified to grow directly into a new complete individual, when it is present in a suitable medium for its growth Sporogony stages:   - After the spore maturation, it liberates from the mother plant to spread in air - When it reaches a suitable medium for growth, it absorbs water and its coat ruptures - It divides several times by mitosis, till it grows into a new individual Advantages of sporogony:    - Quick propagation - Distribution to distant regions Key Point: The main aim of sporogony is the tolerance to the hard conditions, where the spore surrounds itself with a thick coat, till the improvement of surrounding conditions and providing the suitable germination conditions 5- Parthenogenesis:   Parthenogenesis: It is the ability of ovum to develop into a new individual without being fertilized by the male gamete"
118,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"by the male gamete Parthenogenesis is considered a special form of the asexual reproduction, because the progeny comes from one parent only, resulting from the female gamete Parthenogenesis occurs in a number of worms, crustaceans and insects Way of its occurrence: parthenogenesis can occur naturally or artificially, as follows:   A- Natural parthenogenesis:   From the examples for insects that reproduce by natural parthenogenesis:   1- Honey bees:   The queen produces eggs by meiosis, where:   -Some of the eggs (n) grow by parthenogenesis without fertilization (asexual reproduction) to form haploid males (n) drones - Some of the eggs (n) grow after fertilization (sexual reproduction) to form the diploid (2n) queen or workers (according to the type of food) 2- Aphid insect:   The females of aphid insect produce:   - Ova (2n) by mitosis that grow by parthenogenesis without fertilization (asexual reproduction) to form diploid females (2n)"
119,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"females (2n) Or    - Ova (n) by meiosis that grow after fertilization (sexual reproduction) to form diploid (2n) males and females B- Artificial parthenogenesis:   Examples:    - Frog and sea star:   Parthenogenesis is induced artificially by activating the eggs through their exposure to thermal or electric shock, radiation, some salts, agitation or pricking with a needle, leading to the duplication of the chromosomes without fertilization, forming new individuals that are totally identical to their mother - Rabbits: by using similar stimuli (as the previous stimuli) to form early embryonic stages of rabbits from their eggs 6- Tissue culture:   Scientists study the tissue culture on animals and plants:   Tissue culture: It is the growth of a living tissue (its cells contain the whole genetic information) in a semi-natural nutritive medium, then following its tissues differentiation and progress into a fully developed individuals"
120,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"individuals The scientific principle for plant tissue culture:   The plant cell that comprises the whole genetic information can develop into a fully plant, if it is cultivated in a proper nutritive medium, containing the plant hormones with certain ratios Remember that:   Plant tissue culture: it is one of the vegetative reproduction methods that is considered from the asexual reproduction forms, and it occurs through the different plant parts (root — stem — leaves) without the need to seeds (occurs by mitosis) Experiment 1 On carrot plant:   - Separation of small pieces of carrot plant in glass tubes containing the coconut milk (which comprises the whole plant hormones and nutrients that are necessary for the plant growth), then these pieces began to grow and differentiate into a fully carrot plant -Separation of some cells from the same plant tissues and cultivating them by the same method to obtain a whole plant"
121,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"a whole plant Experiment 2 On tobacco plant:   - Separation of some cells from tobacco leaves and cultivating them by the same previous method, and so we can obtain a fully tobacco plant The importance of tissue culture:   1- Propagation of rare plants or those with desirable strains or more resistant against diseases 2- Controlling the time of tissue culture, where the selected tissues for such culture can be preserved in a liquid nitrogen to cool them for a long period, in order to keep them alive and maintain their vitality till their cultivation Note: Scientists have hopes on the progress of this technology in:   - Shortening the time needed for growing and increasing the crops - Solving the food problems in general"
122,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"Second Sexual reproduction:   General characteristics:   -It provides the descendants with continuous innovations in their genetic content that enables them to continue in facing the environmental changes -It needs more time and consumes more energy than the asexual reproduction, because of the following reasons:   1- It usually occurs after the elapse of a certain period of the organism’s age, and in some cases the parents should prepare the proper house, nest or burrow before mating 2- Parents may alternate guarding the eggs and protecting their offsprings, till they grow 3- Some forms face more hardships in order to protect their offsprings, as they keep their embryos within their bodies, to be formed till birth 4- The offsprings may remain with their parents in a social life for more protection and leaving more about their behaviour"
123,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"their behaviour 5- It is highly biological consuming, because the production of new individuals is limited to the half number of species members which are the females only Way of its occurrence:   On the mating of two individuals (male and female), the fertilization usually occurs by the fusion of the male gamete with the female gamete (suitable for its species) to form the zygote which divides mitotically and grows to form the embryo, then to the young and the adult The type of division upon which it depends:   Sexual reproduction depends on meiotic division, when forming the gametes (male gamete — female gamete), where the number of chromosomes is reduced to its half (n), and during fertilization, the male gamete fuses with the female gamete, therefore the original number of chromosomes (2n) returns which differs according to the species of the living organism 2n Original cell is divided by Meiosis(I) into 2 cells of n then each cell will be divided by Meiosis(II) into 2 cells of n"
124,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"into 2 cells of n Characteristics of the offspring: The young (resulting individual) gathers between the characters of two parents, where it receives the genetic material from both parents, and thus it becomes a blend from both of them Publicity : It is common in:   - Many plants -Reproduction by sexual gametes Forms of sexual reproduction:   1- Conjugation:   Most primitive organisms, such as some protozoans, algae and fungi reproduce by two methods which are:   - Asexual reproduction by mitotic division: which occurs in the suitable conditions - Sexual reproduction by conjugation: which occurs in the unsuitable conditions, such as their exposure to a drought or a change in the water temperature or its purity Conjugation in Spirogyra alga:   - Spirogyra alga is known by the green scum which is more common in the standing water, where its filaments float and each filament is formed of one row of cells"
125,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"of one row of cells - Spirogyra alga resorts to reproduce by conjugation (in unsuitable conditions), and there are two types of conjugations which are:   A- Scalariform conjugation:   It occurs between the opposite cells of two longitudinally adjacent filaments of Spirogyra, as follows:   1- Two filaments of Spirogyra become adjacent to each other longitudinally 2- Protrusions grow inwards between some opposite pairs of cells 3- The protrusions meet each other and the separating wall between them disappears, forming the conjugation tube 4- The protoplasm of one filament cells rolls up into a sphere and moves through the conjugation tube to the opposite filament cells, forming the zygote (2n) 5- The zygote is coated by a thick wall that protects it from the unsuitable conditions, meanwhile it is called the zygospore (2n) which remains dormant, till the surrounding conditions are improved"
126,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"are improved 6- The nucleus of zygospore divides meiotically to form four haploid nuclei (n), where three of them degenerate and the fourth nucleus remains 7- The fourth nucleus divides mitotically to form a new algal filament (n) Note: The cells of Spirogyra filament are haploid (n) and after the conjugation, the zygote is formed which is diploid (2n) So, the nucleus of zygospore divides by meiosis before the germination of a new algal filament to return into the haploid number of chromosomes (n) for the cells again B- Lateral conjugation:   This conjugation occurs in case of the presence of one algal filament only It occurs between the adjacent cells of the same algal filament, where the protoplasm of one cell moves to the adjacent cell through an opening in the separating wall between them Lateral Conjugation in Spirogyra:   1- One algal filament is composed of adjacent haploid (n) cells 2- Conjugation tube formation occurs between two neighboring cells of the same filament"
127,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"the same filament 3- The contents of one cell (the active gamete) migrate through the conjugation tube into the adjacent cell (passive gamete) Both nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote (2n) 4- The zygote develops a thick wall and becomes a zygospores (2n) — a dormant stage for protection and survival 5- When conditions are favorable, the zygospore undergoes meiotic division, producing haploid (n) cells 6-One of the resulting haploid cells undergoes germination, developing by mitosis to form a new algal filament composed of haploid cells (n) From the previous we can make the following comparison between Scalariform conjugation in Spirogyra and lateral conjugation in spirogyra:   1- Scalariform conjugation in Spirogyra:   - It occurs between the opposite cells of two algal filaments that are adjacent longitudinally - The components of one cell move to the opposite cell on the opposite filament - The cell components move through a conjugation tube between the two opposite cells"
128,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"two opposite cells - It leads to a high variation in the genetic characters 2- lateral conjugation in spirogyra:   - It occurs between two adjacent cells in the same algal filament - The components of one cell move to the adjacent cell on the same filament - The cell components move through an opening in the separating wall between the two adjacent cells - It leads to a little variation in the genetic characters 2- Reproduction by sexual gametes:   The higher plants and animals reproduce by sexual gametes (male and female) that are resulted from the meiotic division that takes place in gonads (genital organs) Types of sexual gametes (male gametes-female gametes) Male gametes:   - Producing organ: It is produced by the male gonads (testes — anthers) - Number: It is produced in large numbers, as each primary cell produces four male gametes, because some of them are subjected to loss during their journey to the female gamete"
129,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"the female gamete - Description: Pointed body with little cytoplasm (where it loses most of its cytoplasm during its formation) - Storing food: It doesn’t store food - Locomotion: It can move where the body is provided with a locomotor tail or flagellum (in animals or human) to be able to reach the female gamete - Function: It transports the genetic material to the female gamete during fertilization process Female Gametes:   - Producing organ: It is produced by the female gonads (ovaries) - Number: It is produced in a few numbers, as each primary cell produces one female gamete (ovum — ovule) - Storing food: It stores food (it is often rich in nutrients) - Locomotion: It usually remains stationary within the female body, till fertilization (in case of the internal fertilization) - Function: It receives the genetic material from the male gamete"
130,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"the male gamete Fertilization:   The male gametes may be transported to the female gametes by two different ways and this depends on the living organism species and its environment, as follows:   1- External fertilization:   - occurs in most aquatic animals like bony fishes and toads - Both the male and female throw their gametes together in water where the gametes move through water for the occurrence of fertilization and the development of embryo in water 2- Internal fertilization:   - Occurs in the terrestrial animals that live on land, such as amphibians, birds and mammals - The male should introduce the sperms inside the female body to reach ova for the occurrence of fertilization Fertilization: It is the fusion of the male gamete nucleus (n) with the female gamete nucleus (n) to form the zygote (2n) which divides mitotically and differentiates to an embryo"
131,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"to an embryo Key Point: The whale and dolphin are from the placental mammals that live in aquatic environment, where the fertilization is internal and embryo development is internal From the previous we can compare between the asexual and sexual reproduction, as follows:   1- Asexual reproduction:   - It occurs by the isolation of a body part and its development into a new individual - It depends on the mitotic division - It keeps the constancy of the genetic features - The offspring (resulting individual) fully resembles the parent (original individual) in all of its characters, where it receives its genetic material from one parent - The offsprings (resulting individuals) are less adapted with the changeable environmental conditions - It doesn’t cost time and energy - All the individuals can reproduce and produce new individuals (doesn’t require a mate i it is not highly biological consuming)"
132,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"consuming) - Its most important forms: binary, fission, budding, regeneration, sporogony, parthenogenesis and tissue culture 2- Sexual reproduction:   - It occurs by the fusion of a male gamete with a female gamete that is suitable for its species to form the zygote which divides and develops into an embryo - It necessitates the presence of two individuals that are different in sex (male and female) or a hermaphrodite (bisexual) individual - It depends on the meiotic division during the formation of gametes, then the mitotic division for the development - It provides the descendants with continuous innovations in their genetic content - The offspring (resulting individual) gathers between the characters of the two parents, where it receives its genetic material from both parents - The offsprings (resulting individuals) are more adapted with the changeable environmental conditions - It costs more time and energy"
133,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"time and energy - Production of new individuals is limited on half the number of species members only which are the females (it is highly biological consuming) - Its forms: conjugation and reproduction by sexual gametes Alteration of generations phenomenon:   There are some plant and animal species that can breed by both the asexual and sexual reproduction during their life cycle to gain the advantages of both methods together, where:   1- Sexual reproduction: achieves the genetic diversity that enables them to disperse widely and conform with the environmental fluctuations 2- Asexual reproduction: achieves the rapid production and large number of offsprings This may be associated with the variation of the chromosomal number in the cells of these alternated generations"
134,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"generations Alteration of generations: It is a phenomenon of the succession of two or more generations in the life cycle of an organism, where there is a generation that reproduces sexually and alternates with one generation or more that reproduces asexually This phenomenon can be shown by studying the two following examples:   First Life cycle of malaria Plasmodium (malaria parasite):   - Plasmodium is considered from the sporozoan that parasites on both the human and the female Anopheles mosquito - In the life cycle of Plasmodium, there is a generation that reproduces sexually by gametes (in mosquito), then generations that reproduce asexually by sporogony (in mosquito) and by schizogony (in human) Remember that:   Parasitism: it is a relation between two organisms where one of them (parasite) depends on the other (host) in building its body and continuing its life, by gaining its food completely or partially, while the other is harmed by different harms"
135,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"by different harms A- The Life cycle in human body:   1- The life cycle starts, when the female Anopheles mosquito that is infected by the parasite bites the human skin and pours minute spindle-shaped structures called sporozoites (n) in his blood 2- The sporozoites move with blood to the liver, where they spend an incubation period during which they make two cycles of asexual reproduction, where the nucleus divides by schizogony to produce the merozoites (n) 3- The merozoites move to infect the red blood cells, where they spend several asexual cycles to produce many merozoites 4- The merozoites are released in huge numbers every two days, after the destruction of infected red blood cells and toxic substances are released Meanwhile, the symptoms of malaria fever appear on the patient (such as an increase in temperature fever, chill and heavy sweating)"
136,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"and heavy sweating) 5- Some merozoites change inside the red blood cells into gametocytes (n) that move from the blood of the patient to the mosquito, when it bites an infected human B- The Life cycle in female mosquito’s body:   6- The gametes produced from gametocytes in RBCs and fuse together, after their maturation in the stomach of mosquito to form the zygote (2n) 7- The zygote changes into ookinete (2n) that penetrates the stomach wall 8- The ookinete divides meiotically, forming an oocyst (n) whose nucleus divides mitotically by sporogony, where it produces many sporozoites (n), and this is considered an asexual reproduction 9- The sporozoites (n) are released and move to the salivary glands of the mosquito, being ready to infect another human"
137,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"another human Do you know that:   The male Anopheles mosquito doesn’t infect the human with malaria parasite, as it doesn’t feed on blood, where it has sucking mouthparts and uses them to feed on flowers nectar, while the female has piercing sucking mouthparts by which it sucks the human blood Note: Gametocytes of malaria Plasmodium in the blood of the infected human are considered immature gametes, and inside the female Anopheles mosquito’s stomach their maturation occurs Key Point:   In the life cycle of malaria Plasmodium:   - The main host is the female Anopheles mosquito inside which the sexual reproduction occurs - The infective phase for human is the sporozoites - The infective phase for female Anopheles mosquito is the gametocytes From the previous, we can illustrate the phases of malaria Plasmodium life cycle in the following table:   Phase name:   1- Sporozoites:   - Site of presence:   In human: In liver cells In female Anopheles mosquito: In salivary glands"

140,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"spore cells (2n) 2- The spore cells (2n) divide by meiosis, giving the spores (n), and on the spores maturation, they are released from the sporangia and carried by wind to far distances B-Gametophyte phase (n):   3- When the spore falls on a wet soil, it germinates forming several cells that develop and differentiate immediately into a flat body which grows in the form of a heart Shape above the wet soil, and it is known as the gametophyte phase whose lower surface is characterized by the presence of the following:   - Rhizoids: grow on the posterior region of the lower surface of gametophyte as processes to absorb water and salts - Genital processes: grow on the anterior region of the lower surface of gametophyte and they are two types which are:   Antheridium (male organs): produce the male gametes (ciliated sperms) Archegonia (female organs): produce the female gametes (eggs)"
141,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Continue: Methods of Reproduction in Living Organisms,"gametes (eggs) 4- After the maturation of antheridium, the male gametes (ciliated sperms) liberate from them and swim over the soil water, till they reach the mature archegonium to fertilize its egg forming the zygote (2n) 5- The zygote divides and differentiates into a new sporophyte that grows over the gametophyte 6- The sporophyte depends for a short time on the gametophyte, till it develops its own roots, stem and leaves 7- The gametophyte degenerates, while the sporophyte grows to repeat the life cycle From the previous, we can compare between the sporophyte phase and gametophyte phase of polypodies plant, as follows:   Sporophyte phase in polypodies plant:   - It consists of transverse roots, stem, rhizome and leaves that carry sori on their lower surfaces which contain sporangia that have numerous spore cells (2n)"

147,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"into a perianth Functions of the flower:   The flower performs its functions in reproduction for the species continuity, and this requires the following:   First Pollen grains formation:   If you examine a T in a mature anther of a large-sized stamen, as in lily plant, you will find that the anther consists of four sacs of pollen grains in which the pollen grains are formed, as follows:   1- During the flower development (before the formation of pollen grains), these sacs are full of large-nucleated diploid cells contain (2n) chromosomes called the spore mother cells 2- Each spore mother cell divides meiotically, forming four haploid cells contain (n) chromosomes called the microspores 3- The nucleus of microspore divides mitotically into two nuclei, where one of them is called the tube nucleus and the other one is called the generative nucleus, therefore the pollen grain is formed, then its wall becomes thick for its protection"
148,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"for its protection 4- The anther becomes mature and the separating wall between each two adjacent pollen sacs degenerate, then the sacs open and the pollen grains become ready for dispersal Second Ovules formation:   During the formation of pollen grains in the anther, parallel changes occur in the ovary, as follows:   1- The ovule starts to appear as a simple swelling on the inner wall of the ovary, and it contains a large spore mother cell (2n) During the ovule growth:   - A funicle develops which connects the ovule with the ovary wall and through which the nutrients reach it - Two integuments develop which surround the ovule completely, except a minute hole called the micropyle through which the ovule is fertilized 2- The spore mother cell (2n) divides inside the ovule meiotically, giving a row of four haploid cells contain (n) chromosomes"
149,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"(n) chromosomes 3- Three of these cells degenerate and the fourth remains and grows rapidly, forming the embryonic sac which is surrounded by a nutritive tissue called the nucellus 4- Inside the embryonic sac, many stages occur, as follows:   a- The nucleus divides mitotically three times, giving 8 nuclei, where each four of them migrate to one pole of the embryonic sac b- From each four nuclei, one nucleus moves to the center of the embryonic sac, which are called the two polar nuclei (two embryonic sac nuclei) c- Each nucleus of the remaining three nuclei at each of the two poles of embryonic sac is enveloped by an amount of cytoplasm and a thin membrane, forming distinct cells d- The middle cell of the three cells that are close to the micropyle grows to become the egg cell, while the two side cells are called synergids, and the three cells that are distant from the micropyle are called the antipodal cells Meanwhile, the egg cell becomes ready for fertilization"
150,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"for fertilization Note: The egg cell represents the female gamete in the flowering plants Key Point: The number of nuclei and cells that result from the division of one spore mother cell in the flower's ovary:   Spore mother cell (2n) divides by meiosis into Spore cells (n) like Spore cell (degenerate) and Embryonic sac cell which divides by mitosis of the nucleus (Three times) Nuclei which are Nuclei (Antipodal cells), Embryonic sac nuclei (two polar nuclei), Egg cell nucleus and Nuclei(Synergids) Third Pollination and fertilization:   A- Pollination in flowering plants:   Pollination in flowering plants: It is the process of transferring the pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of flower Types of Pollination:   1- Self-pollination:   - Definition: The transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower, or to the stigma of another flower on the same plant"
151,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"on the same plant - Factors needed for its occurrence: The flowers are hermaphrodite, where:   The organs of two sexes must be matured at the same time and the anther level must be higher than the stigma level The plant contains male flowers and female flowers 2- Cross-pollination:   - Definition: The transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a flower on a plant to the stigma of a flower on another plant of the same species - Factors needed for its occurrence: The flowers are hermaphrodite, where:   The organs of one sex must be matured before the other sex organs (early maleness or early femalness) and the level of anther must be lower than the level of stigma The plant contains unisexual flowers only (male only or female only) Means of pollen grains transportation in cross-pollination:   - Air The importance of the pollination process:   It provides the flower with the male cells which are necessary for the fertilization process in the ovule that forms the seed"
152,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"that forms the seed It stimulates the activity of auxins which are necessary for the development and growth of the ovary into a mature fruit (even if the fertilization doesn't take place) B- Fertilization in Flowering Plants:   This process includes two important steps, which are:   First step (Pollen grain germination):   When the pollen grain falls on the stigma, it begins to germinate, where:   - The tube nucleus forms a pollen tube which penetrates the stigma and style, till it reaches the micropyle site in the ovary - The tube nucleus degenerates, while the generative nucleus divides mitotically to form two male nuclei Second step (Double fertilization): it includes two stages which are:   1- fertilization of the egg cell:   It occurs, as follows:   - One of the two male nuclei (n) is transmitted from the pollen grain to the ovule through the pollen tube - This nucleus fuses with the egg cell nucleus (n), forming the zygote (2n)"
153,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"the zygote (2n) - The zygote starts to divide mitotically, forming the embryo (2n) Male nucleus (n) + Egg cell nucleus (n) by Fertilization gives Zygote(2n) then perform Mitotic division to give Embryo (2n) 2- Triple fusion:   It occurs, as follows:   - The other male nucleus (n) is transmitted from the pollen grain to the ovule - The male nucleus fuses with the two nuclei of the embryonic sac (2n) (two polar nuclei, where each one of them is (n)), forming the endosperm nucleus that is triploid (3n) - The endosperm nucleus divides, forming the endosperm tissue that nourishes the embryo during its early development stages, and this tissue remains outside the embryo, and so it occupies a part of the seed Male nucleus (n) + Two nuclei of the embryonic sac (n) + (n) by Triple fusion gives Endosperm nucleus (3n) Triple fusion: It is the process of fusion of one of the two male nuclei of a pollen grain with the two embryonic sac nuclei to form the endosperm nucleus"
154,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"endosperm nucleus From the previous, we can define the double fertilization, as follows :   Double fertilization: It is the fusion of one of the two male nuclei (n) of a pollen grain with the egg cell nucleus (n) to form the zygote (2n) which divides mitotically, forming the embryo (2n), and the fusion of the other male nucleus (n) with the nucleus resulted from the fusion of the two embryonic sac nuclei two polar nuclei (each of them is (n)), forming the endosperm nucleus (3n) which divides to form the endosperm tissue Key Points: The number of male nuclei that result from the division of a spore mother cell in the flower's anther:   spore mother cell (2n) is divided by meiosis to Microspores (n) which is divided by mitosis of the nucleus into Pollen grains (n) which contain Tube nuclei (n) and Generative nuclei (n)which is divided by mitosis into Male nuclei(n)"
155,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"into Male nuclei(n) Fourth Fruit and seed formation:   After the fertilization, the calyx, corolla, androecium, style and stigma wilt and fall out, and the ovary only remains A- Fruit formation:   1- The ovary stores food, increases in size and ripens, transforming into a fruit, by the action of hormones (auxins) that are secreted by the ovary 2- The ovary's wall transforms into the pericarp False fruit: It is the fruit in which any part, except its ovary, enlarges with food such as apple fruit in which the receptacle is enlarged (which is eaten) B- Seed formation:   1- The two synergid cells and antipodal cells decay, while the micropyle remains to allow the entry of water into the seed on the germination 2- The ovule's wall becomes the seed coat (testa) Note: The number of nuclei that share in the seed or grain formation is 5 nuclei (Egg cell nucleus + Two male nuclei + Two embryonic sac nuclei)"
156,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"sac nuclei) We can differentiate between the seeds regarding to their retention of endosperm into endospermic seeds and exendospermic seeds, as follows:   Endospermic seeds (Grains):   - The embryo keeps the endosperm, so that it remains present - The integuments of the ovary and ovule fuse together, forming a single-seeded fruit, meanwhile it is called the grain Exendospermic seeds (Seeds):   - The embryo feeds on all the endosperm during its development So, the plant has to store another food for the embryo in two cotyledons - The integuments of the ovule harden, forming the seed coat or testa, meanwhile it is called the seed The fruits and seeds maturation (often) leads to the discontinuity of the plant vegetative growth and sometimes to its death, especially in the annual plants, due to the consumption of the stored nutritive substances and inhibition of hormones If pollination and fertilization don't take place, the flower wilts and drops off without fruit formation"
157,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"fruit formation There are some fruits which keep some parts of the flower, for example:   - Pomegranate fruit: the leaves of calyx and stamens remain - Eggplant and dates fruits: the calyx leaves remain - Marrow fruit: the corolla leaves remain Do you know?   The annual plants are plants that complete their life cycle within a single growing season, then degenerate after leaving their seeds in the soil From the previous, we can summarize:   1- Stage of pollen grains formation:   Anther contains 4 sacs of pollen grains (before the formation of pollen grains), they are full of Spore nuclear cells (2n) and each cell divides nucleotides to form 4 microspores (n) where each microspore converts into a pollen grain, after the mitotic division of its nucleus into:   -Generative nucleus which divides mitotically to form Two male nuclei -Tube nucleus which forms a pollen tube that penetrates the stigma and style, till it reaches the micropyle site in the ovary, then the tube nucleus degenerates"
158,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"nucleus degenerates 2- Stages of ovary maturation in the plant:   Ovary (on its interior wall), appears the Ovule which contains the Spore mother cell (2n) which is divided by meiotically to form 4 cells (n) three cells degenerate and the fourth grows rapidly to give Embryonic sac where its nucleus divides mitotically three times to produce 8 nuclei:   - 3 nuclei are distant from the micropyle and each one of them is surrounded by a cytoplasm and thin membrane to give Three antipodal cells - 3 nuclei are close to the micropyle and each of them is surrounded by a cytoplasm and thin membrane to give Two synergids and Egg cell (in the middle) 3- Double fertilization process in plant:   - Male nucleus (n) + Egg cell nucleus (n) by fertilization gives Zygote (2n) which divides by Mitosis to give Embryo (2n) and its possible that:   Embryo keeps the endosperm forming a grain (with one cotyledon)"
159,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"one cotyledon) - Male nucleus (n) + Two embryonic sac nuclei (n)+(n) by Triple fusion gives Endosperm nucleus (3n) which is Divides to give Endosperm tissue and its possible that:   Embryo feeds on the endosperm Forming a seed (with two cotyledons) 4- The fate of flower's components in the following cases:   Flower in case of:   1- The non-occurrence of pollination and fertilization:   The flower wills and drops off 2- The occurrence of pollination only (without fertilization):   The auxin's activity will be stimulated that are needed for the growth of the ovary into a ripen fruit without seeds 3- The occurrence of pollination and fertilization:   - Floral whorls:   Clays, corolla, androecium, style and stigma wilt or    Some fruits may keep some of its parts as:   calyx as eggplants and dates fruits, calyx and stamens as pomegranate fruit, and Corolla as Marrow fruit - Ovary's walls changes into Pericarp - Ovule's walls changes into Seed coat (Testa)"
160,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"Seed coat (Testa) - Ovule changes into Seed as: Endospermic (Grain) and Exendospermic (Seed) - Two embryonic sac nuclei changes into Endosperm tissue which: Remains in grains (one cotyledon) and Consumed in seeds (two cotyledons) -Micropyle Remains to allow the entry of water into the seed, on germination Parthenocarpy:   Parthenocarpy: It is the development of fruits that are devoid of seeds, because they are formed without fertilization (which is not considered a reproduction) - Types of parthenocarpy:   1- Natural: as in banana and pineapple 2- Artificial: it is carried out by one way of the following two ways to stimulate the ovary to form the fruit:   - Spraying the stigma with the extract of pollen grains (pollen grains powder in ether alcohol) - Using indole or naphthol acetic acid From the previous, we can compare between the parthenocarpy and parthenogenesis, as follows:   Parthenocarpy:   - Occurs in plants"
161,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Flowering Plants,"- Occurs in plants - The ability of ovary to form a fruit that is devoid of seeds, as it is formed without fertilization - Is not considered a reproduction - Occurs naturally as in banana and pineapple - Occurs artificially by spraying the stigmas with the extract of pollen grains or by using indole or naphthol acetic acid to stimulate the ovary to form the fruit Parthenogenesis:   - Occurs in animals - The ability of ovum to develop into a new individual without fertilization by a male gamete - Is considered a special type of asexual reproduction - Occurs naturally as in aphid insect and honey bees - Occurs artificially by activating the eggs (ova) through their exposure to a thermal or an electric shock, radiation, some salts, agitation or pricking with needles, as in frog and sea star, or by using similar stimuli to form early embryos from their ova, as in rabbits"
162,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"Human belongs to the class Mammalia which is characterized by the following:   - Carrying the embryo inside the uterus till the birth, so that their ova are small and nearly devoid of yolk, because the embryo depends on the mother to get food, as it develops inside the uterus - The production of offsprings is few, due to the parental care, where human shows the highest degree of care, as the offsprings require several years of raising, due to their mental progress that God provided them to be superior over the other creatures Do you know?   Yolk is the stored food in the ova upon which the embryo depends during its development - Functions:   The production of sperms The secretion of male sex hormones that are responsible for the appearance of the male secondary sex characters, such as the deep (harsh) voice, the muscles strength, the growth of facial hair, … etc"
163,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"facial hair, … etc - Structure: the male genital system of human consists of:   1- Testes:   - Testes are surrounded by the scrotal sac (scrotum) that descends outside the body to maintain their temperature lower than the body temperature which is suitable for spermatogenesis inside them - Importance of testes: Production of sperms and Secretion of testosterone hormone that works on the growth of prostate gland and two seminal vesicles, and the appearance of male secondary sex characters at puberty Note: The two testes move out of the abdominal cavity into the scrotum in the embryo during the last months of pregnancy, but if their descending is failed, they will stop producing sperms at puberty, causing the infertility 2- Two epididymides:   - Each epididymis is a tube that is coiled around itself, comes out from the testis and leads to a tube called vas deferens - Function of epididymes: The sperms are stored in them"
164,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"are stored in them 3- Two vasa deferentia:   - Each vas deferens is a tube that extends from the epididymis and pours in the urethra - Transport the sperms from the epididymis to the urethra 4- Genital accessory glands:   - They include:   Two seminal vesicles: each of them secretes an alkaline fluid that contains fructose sugar to nourish the sperms Prostate gland and two Cowper's glands: Secrete an alkaline fluid that passes through the urethra (just before the passage of sperms directly), in order to neutralize its acidic medium, therefore it becomes a suitable neutral medium for the passage of sperms 5- Penis: Spongy organ in which the urethra passes, where it transports the urine and sperms (separately) to outside the body Do you know?   Sperms don't store food inside them, but they depend on fructose sugar (that is present in the secreted fluid from the two seminal vesicles) that is used as a source of energy required to reach the ovum and fertilize it"
165,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"and fertilize it The microscopic structure of the testis: By studying a transverse section in the testis, we found that it consists of:   1- Seminiferous tubules:   They are present with a large number inside the testis Inside each seminiferous tubule, there are two types of cells which are:   - Primary germ cells (2n): line the seminiferous tubules internally and they divide several times to form the sperms at the end - Sertoli cells: secrete a fluid to nourish the sperms inside the testis, as well as it is supposed that they have also an immunization function Do you know?   Sertoli cells were named by this name after the Italian scientist (Ennico Sertoli) who discovered and described them in 1865 2- Interstitial cells:    They are found among the luminiferous tubules They secrete the testosterone and androsterone hormones that are responsible for the appearance of the male secondary sex characters at puberty, and the growth of prostate gland and two seminal vesicles"
166,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"seminal vesicles Spermatogenesis stages:   Spermatogenesis process passes through four important stages, which are as follows:   1- Multiplication stage:   - In which the mitotic division takes place several times for the primary germ cells (2n) - As a result of this division, a great number of cells called the spermatogonia (2n) is produced 2- Growth stage:   - In which the spermatogonia store an amount of food, then they transform into primary spermatocytes (2n) 3- Maturation stage:   - In this stage, the primary spermatocytes (2n) are divided by meiosis (I), giving secondary spermatocytes (n) (i the number of chromosomes is reduced to its half) - The secondary spermatocytes (n) are divided by meiosis (II), giving spermatids (n) 4- Metamorphosis stage:   - In which the spermatids are changed into sperms (n)"
167,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,into sperms (n) Key Point: The number of sperms that result from the division of one cell of spermatogonia in the testis:   Cell of spermatogonia (2n) converts into Primary spermatocyte (2n) which is divided by Meiosis (I) to give Secondary spermatocytes (n) which is divided by Meiosis (II) to give Spermatids (n) which is convert into Sperms(n) Structure of sperm:   1- Head:   Contains:   - Nucleus: with 23 chromosomes - Acrosome:   Found at the forehead Secretes hyaluronidase enzyme that dissolves a part of the ovum coat to facilitate the penetration process of the sperm into the ovum 2- Neck: contains two centrioles which play an important role in the division of the fertilized ovum 3- Midpiece: contains mitochondria which supply the sperm with the energy required for its movement 4- Tail:   - Consists of an axis which ends with a caudal piece

169,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"ovary every month - Importance of ovary:   Production of ova Secretion of puberty hormones, menstrual cycle regulation and embryo formation 2- Two fallopian tubes:   - Each tube opens with a funnel in front of each ovary that:   Lies directly in front of the ovary to ensure the fall of ova inside it Contains finger-like processes to pick up the ovum - Each tube is lined internally with cilia to direct the ova towards the uterus 3- Uterus:   - Elastic muscular sac that is present between the pelvis bones, and provided by a strong and thick muscular wall - Lined with a glandular membrane - Ends with a cervix that opens into the vagina - Inside which the embryo is formed within nine months 4- Vagina:   - Muscular tube whose length reaches about 7 cm, starts from the cervix and ends with the genital opening - Vagina is lined with a membrane that secretes mucous fluid to moisten the vagina - It contains folds that allow its expansion, especially during the delivery"
170,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"during the delivery Notes:   - As a female approaches puberty (at the age of 12 - 15 years), there are monthly rhythmic changes that take place in the female genital system according to the ovarian and uterine activities and what is correlated with them of fertilization and pregnancy, or non-pregnancy and the monthly bleeding menstruation - At the age of (45 - 50 years), the ovaries become inactive, therefore the hormones secretion decreases, the endometrium shrinks and the occurrence of menstruation is stopped Microscopic structure of the ovary:   By studying a transverse section of the ovary, we notice that:   - The ovary consists of a group of cells in different development stages - The ovum is placed inside the Graafian follicle - The Graafian follicle is transformed into a corpus luteum, after releasing the ovum from it"
171,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"the ovum from it Oogenesis stages:   - The process of oogenesis passes through three important stages, which are as follows:   1- Multiplication stage:   - This stage occurs during the development of the female embryo, where:   Mitotic division of the primary germ cells (2n) takes place This division results in the formation of cells called oogonia (2n) 2- Growth stage:   - This stage occurs during the female embryo development, where:   The oogonia (2n) store an amount of food, therefore they increase in size and transform into primary oocytes (2n) 3- Maturation stage:   - The primary oocytes (2n) are divided by meiosis (I), giving:   Secondary oocyte (n) The secondary oocyte is larger than the polar body, as it contains the stored food - The secondary oocyte (n) is divided by meiosis (II), giving:   Ovum (n) And meiosis (II) occurs in the fallopian tube once the sperm penetrates the ovum to accomplish the fertilization (i it is a delayed or conditioned division)"
172,Reproduction in Living Organisms,Reproduction in Human Being,"division) - Meiosis (II) may occur to the polar body (n), giving two polar bodies (and so the total number will be three polar bodies) Key Point: The number of ova that result from the division of one cell of oogonia in the human female ovary:   cell of oogonia(2n) converts into Primary oocyte (2n) which is divided by Meiosis(I) to give:   - Secondary oocyte(n) which is divided by Meiosis(II) at fertilization moment to give Ovum (n) + Polar body (n) - Polar body (n) which is divided by Meiosis(II) may occur to give Polar bodies (n) From the previous, we can make the following Comparison Between formation stages of the sperm (Spermatogenesis) and Formation stages of the ovum (Oogenesis):   Formation stages of the sperm (Spermatogenesis):   - They include four stages: Multiplication, growth, maturation and metamorphosis - All stages take place inside the male testis - It is a continuous process that takes place from the puberty till the death"

201,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Plant,"inside the plant Structural immunity includes two types of immune mechanisms (means), which are: A- Pre-existing structural defenses in plant:   1- Epidermal cells of the plant surface:   The epidermis acts as the first bulwark in the resistance of pathogens, as it is characterized by the presence of some defensive structures that cover the epidermis, such as:     - Waxy layer that forms a water-repellent surface (water doesn’t settle on the surface), therefore the suitable environment for the growth of of fungi and the reproduction of bacteria is not available Or     - Hairs or thomas that avoid:   The accumulation of water to decrease the chances of infection with diseases Being eaten by the grazing animals 2- Cell wall:   It represents the outer protection for cells, especially the epidermal layer cells, as it consists mainly of cellulose and after its thickening by lignin, it becomes rigid So, it will be difficult to be penetrated by pathogens"
202,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Plant,"by pathogens Do you know?    The plant epidermis is covered by a layer of cuticle that consists of cutin and above which there is a waxy layer which is more able to resist the diseases, as it is difficult to be hydrolyzed, and it is hydrophobic, therefore water doesn’t settle on it B- Induced structural defenses as response to infection by pathogens:   1-Formation of cork (phellem):   -The cork is formed to isolate the plant areas that were exposed to cut or tear, which prevents the pathogen entry to the plant -The plant areas are exposed to cut or tear, due to the:    - Increase in the thickness of plant during its growth 2- Formation of tylosis:   Tylosis: They are overgrowth of the protoplast of the adjacent living parenchyma cells which protrude into the xylem vessels and tracheids through pits -tylosis are formed as a result of the exposure of the plant vascular system to cut or invasion by pathogens"
203,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Plant,"by pathogens -Importance of tylosis:   They obstruct the movement of pathogens to the other parts of the plant 3- Deposition of gums:   The plants exposed to wounds or cutting secrete the gum substance around the locus of infection to prevent the entry of microbes inside the plant through the cut or wounded parts 4- Cellular immune structures:   They are cellular structures in the plant where some morphological changes occur, as a result of the pathogens invasion Examples:   -The swelling of the walls of a the epidermal cells and the cells under the epidermis during the direct penetration of the pathogen, leading to the inhibition of its penetration process to those cells -Surrounding the mycelium which attacks the plant with an insulating cover to prevent the transmission of fungus from a cell to another"

206,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Plant,"result of infection Function: they react with the toxins that are produced by the pathogenic organisms and change them into non-toxic compounds for the plants Example: Detoxifying enzymes that are sometimes produced by the plants to interact with the toxins produced by the pathogens and invalidate their toxicity 4- inducible post-infection:   Some plants promote and strengthen their defenses after infection, in order to protect themselves from any new infection by the continual presence of the chemical compounds that are formed due to the infection Do you know?   Plant phenols: are concentrated in the leaves, flowers, fruits and roots, and have a role in resisting the bacteria and fungi and increasing the hardness of plant tissues, as well as attracting insects to complete the pollination and fertilization Processes"

219,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"the antibodies - Cytotoxic T-cells (TC):   Their function: they attack the foreign cells, such as the cancer cells, the transplanted organs and the body cells which are infected with the virus - Suppressor T-cells (TS):   Their functions: They regulate the degree of immune response to the required limit and They discourage or inhibit the action of T-cells and B-cells after the elimination of the pathogen 3- Natural killer cells(NK):   -Their percentage : they represent about 5 : 10% of the lymphocytes in blood -Their site of formation and nate real maturation : formed and matured in the red bone marrow -Their function : they attack the infected body cells with viruses and cancer cells and kill them by the enzymes they secrete Key Points:   1- Average percentage of lymphocytes (20 : 30%) = No of white blood cells * 25 / 100 2- Percentage of T-lymphocytes = No 3- Average percentage of B-lymphocytes (10 : 15%) = No 4- Average percentage of natural killer cells (5 : 10%) = No"
220,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"(5 : 10%) = No 2- Other white blood cells:   They differentiate into main types, as follows:   -Basal cells (Basophils), Acidic cells (Eosinophils) and Neutral cells (Neutrophils):   Their Function:   -Struggle the infection especially the bacterial infection and inflammations, because:   -They contain granules that disintegrate the pathogens’ cells that attack the body,  so that they are called granular cells -They ingest and digest the pathogens (phagocytosis) -Single-core cells (Monocytes) Non-granular cells:   Function:   -destroy the foreign bodies and change into phagocytes when needed that engulf the foreign organisms Note: Basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils are:   - Distinguishable by their size, the shape of the nucleus and the color of granules appeared inside them under the microscope - Still in the blood circulation for a relatively short period of time, ranging from several hours to several days"
221,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"to several days 3- Macrophages:   -Their types: macrophages include two main types, which are as follows:    1-Fixed macrophages:   - Their site of presence: are present in most of the body tissues, therefore they are named by different names, according to the tissue where they exist - Their function: they are ready to engulf any foreign body that is present close to it, by phagocytosis, where they pick up the microbes or foreign bodies or senescent somatic cells, such as the senescent red blood cells, and disintegrate them to their primary components to be disposed by the body 2-Mobile macrophages:   - Their functions:   They engulf the foreign bodies (phagocytosis)"
222,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"(phagocytosis) They offer the information which are collected about the microbes and foreign bodies and offer them to the specialized immune cells that are found in the lymphatic nodes which are scattered in the different body parts and prepare the suitable defensive mechanisms, either by the antibodies or the type of killer cells that will deal with the microbes Phagocytosis:   It is a vital process that is occurred mainly by the macrophages and neutrophils, where these cells engulf the foreign bodies and senescent cells by surrounding the body that needs to be ingested by the plasma membrane of the cell, till it is Surrounded completely (type of endocytosis), and it becomes inside the cell in the form of vacuole with which a lysosome or more is fused The foreign body is lysed by the digestive lysosomal enzymes (digestion process), then the cell expels the products of digestion to outside the cell through a process known by exostosis"
223,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"known by exostosis Third Assisting chemical substances:   They are chemicals that assist and cooperate with the specialized mechanisms of the immune system in their action Their types: the assisting chemical substances are varied, as follows:    1- Chemokines:   Their function: they recruit (guide the migration of) the large circulating phagocytes which are found in the blood by large numbers towards the site of existence of microbes or foreign bodies to reduce their reproduction and spreading 2-Interleukin:   Their functions:   -They mediate the communication among the different immune cells -They mediate the communication between the immune system and  different body cells -They help the immune system to perform its defensive function 3- Complements:   -They are a group of different types of proteins and enzymes"
224,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"and enzymes - Their function: they destroy the microbes that are present in blood, after the binding of these complements with the antibodies through lysing the membranes of antigens that are found on the surface of the microbe and dissolving their contents to make them easily engulfed by the phagocytes (white blood cells) 4-Interferon:    - They are different types of proteins that are produced and secreted by the infected tissue cells with viruses and they are not specific for a certain virus - Their function: they prevent the reproduction and spreading of the  virus in the body, where they bind to the healthy cells (not infected by the virus) neighboring to the infected cells and induce (stimulate) them to produce a specific type of enzymes that inhibits the action of replication enzymes of the virus Fourth Antibodies:   They are specific proteins known as immunoglobulins (Ig) and they are Y-shaped"
225,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"they are Y-shaped -Their site of presence: are present in the blood and lymph in the human and other vertebrates -Their origin: they are produced by the plasma B-cells -Their function: antibodies and complements adhere with the foreign bodies (as bacteria) to offer them to the other white blood cells for engulfing and destroying them Remember that:   -Lymph is a filtered fluid from blood plasma during its passage through the blood vessels -Lymph contains nearly most of the plasma constituents, in addition to a large number of leucocytes (white blood cells) How they are formed:   1- On the surface of the foreign bodies (as bacteria) that invade the body tissues, there are compounds called antigens 2- The B-lymphocytes recognize these foreign bodies and particles through the binding of receptors that are present on the surface of B-cells with the antigens that are found on the surface of the microbes"
226,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"of the microbes 3- B-lymphocytes change to specialized B-lymphocytes called plasma B-cells that produce the antibodies which circulate in the bloodstream and lymph against specific type of antigens Antigen: It is any foreign substance, such as the molecules that are present on the surfaces of foreign bodies, such as bacteria and viruses, the antigens stimulate the lymphocytes to perform a series of defensive activities known as the immune response, in order to fight the microbe and destroy it Note: When B-lymphocytes meet (recognize) the antigens for the first time, they divide many times to produce groups of plasma B-cells, where each group of them produces a specific type of antibodies against a specific type of antigens that are present on the surface of the micro-organisms and other foreign particles (i antibodies are specific, where each antibody has a specific antigen to bind with)"
227,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"to bind with) Their types: there are five types which are:   -IgM    -IgA    -IgG    -IgE    -IgD    Structure of the antibody:   The antibody consists of two pairs of polypeptide chains:   - Two long chains that are called heavy chains - Two short chains that are called light chains The four chains are joined together by disulphide bonds The polypeptide chains consist of two parts:   1-Variable region v represents the antigen-binding site:   - Each antibody has two identical antigen-binding sites - The shape of these sites is different from an antibody to another, due to the difference in the conformation of amino acids (their sequence, types and spatial shape) that form the peptide chain in this structural part and determine the specificity of each antibody for one type of antigens"
228,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"type of antigens - These sites help in the occurrence of specific binding between the antigen and its specific antibody in a way that resembles the lock and its key, due to the matching between the variable region of antibody with the antigen as a mirror image, and this binding forms an antigen-antibody complex 2-Constant region c:    It has a constant shape and structure in all the types of antibodies Mechanisms of antibodies:   -Most of antibodies have two antigen-binding sites, while antigens have many binding sites which make a certain confirmed binding between the antibodies and their antigens"
229,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"and their antigens -Antibodies stop the action of antigens by using one of the following mechanisms:   Mechanisms of antibodies:   1-Neutralization:   From the most important functions of antibodies in resisting viruses is neutralizing these viruses and stopping their activity by:   -Binding the antibodies to the outer coat of viruses, as this binding will prevent viruses from adhering to the membranes of the host cells and spreading or passing inside them -Preventing the nucleic acid (genetic material) of the viruses from coming out from the infected cells and replicating inside the host cell by keeping their coat intact or sealed, this is occurred when viruses succeeded in penetrating the host cell membrane"
230,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"host cell membrane 2- Agglutination (Clumping):   Some antibodies such as IgM have many antigen-binding sites which enable each antibody to bind with more than one microbe (antigen), leading to the clumping of microbes on the same antibody, this makes them weaker and liable to be engulfed by the phagocytes, so that the agglutination is considered from the best ways of the antibody mechanisms Note: The microbe may contain more than one type of antigen, so that more than one type of antibody may bind to it 3- Precipitation: This often happens in the soluble antigens, where the binding between the antibodies and these antigens leads to the formation of insoluble complexes in the form of a precipitate of the antigen and antibody, therefore it facilitates their engulfing by the phagocytes (stimulation Precipitation of phagocytosis) 4- Lysis: The binding between the antibodies and antigens activate specific proteins and enzymes called complements"
231,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,"called complements These complements lyse the coats of antigens and dissolve their contents, making them easily engulfed by the phagocytes 5- Antitoxins: Antibodies can bind to toxins, forming complexes of antibodies and toxins These complexes (formed from the binding between antibodies and toxins) activate the complements to react with toxins in a chain reaction which leads finally to their detoxification and also makes them readily engulfed by the phagocytes Antitoxins: In case of the absence of antibodies:   Particles of toxins + The cell  = The cell is destroyed by the action of toxins In case of the presence of antibodies:   Particles of toxins + Antibodies (neutralize the particles of toxins) + The cell = Healthy cell Key Points?    -The number of antibodies’ types that are produced by the plasma yes B-cells are 5 types -The number of antigen-binding sites (variable regions) in the antibody (IgG ice or IgD) are 2 binding sites"
232,Immunity in Living Organisms,Immunity in Man,are 2 binding sites -The number of antigen-binding sites in the antibody (IgM) are 10 binding sites
233,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"There are two systems of immunity in man, which are:   1-Natural (Non-specific or innate) immunity -Acquired (Specific or adaptive) immunity Although the two systems of immunity are different from each other, they work together in a cooperation and harmony, as the innate immunity is essential for the acquired immunity to work successfully and vice versa, where each of them uses different mechanisms that activate the immune response of the other immune system, allowing the body to deal successfully with the pathogenic organisms (pathogens) Mechanism of immune system in man:    First Natural immunity:   First line of defense :   -Skin and sweat - Mucus and  cilia in respiratory tracts -Acidic gastric juice (secretions) HCL acid Second line of defense : -Inflammatory response Second Acquired immunity:   Third line of defense: -Humoral immunity(Antibody-mediated immunity) -Cellular immunity (Celi-mediated immunity)"
234,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"immunity) First Natural (Non-specific or innate) immunity:   Natural (Non-specific or innate) immunity:   -It is a group of defensive mechanisms that protect the body and characterized by a rapid and effective response to resist, fight and destroy any microbe or foreign body that tries to invade the body, these mechanisms are non-specific against certain type of microbes or antigens Natural immunity passes by two successive lines of defense, as follows:   1-First line of defense:   First line of defense: It is a group of physical or natural barriers in the body (such as : skin, mucus, tears, sweat and hydrochloric acid in stomach) and their main function is preventing pathogens from entering the body Means of the first line of defense:   1- Skin:   -It is characterized by a tough horny layer on its surface which acts as a barrier that is difficult to be penetrated or passed through it"
235,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"passed through it -It contains a group of sweat glands that secrete sweat on its surface that can kill most of the microbes, because of its salinity 2- Cerumen (Ear’s wax):   -A substance secreted by the ears in order to kill the microbes that enter the ears to protect them 3- Tears:   -A fluid that protects the eyes from microbes, as it contains antimicrobial substances and enzymes which lyse the microbes 4- Mucus in the respiratory tracts:   A viscous fluid that lines the walls of respiratory (tracts) bronchi to which the microbes and foreign bodies entering with air adhere, then the mucus with the trapped microbes and foreign bodies are expelled outside the body by the action of the beating cilia lining these tracts 5- Saliva:   A fluid contains some toxic substances for the microbes, in addition to some enzymes that can dissolve such microbes"
236,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"such microbes 6- Acidic gastric juice (secretions):   The epithelial cells lining the stomach produce and secrete the strong hydrochloric acid (HCI) that can kill the microbes entering with food Key Points:   The first line of defense in the body includes:   - Mechanical means, such as: skin, membranes lining the alimentary canal and cilia in the respiratory tracts lining - Chemical means, such as: sweat, tears, saliva, cerumen, mucus and acidic gastric secretions The sweat glands, lacrimal glands and salivary glands are considered immune glands with external secretions (exocrine glands) 2-Second line of defense:   This line of defense acts, if the pathogens succeeded in penetrating the means of the first line of defense and invaded the body tissues through a slash in the skin for example"
237,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"skin for example Second line of defense:   It is an internal defensive system in which the body uses successive non-specific mechanisms that surround the invading microbes to prevent them from spreading, and it starts with the occurrence of a severe inflammation Inflammatory response:   It is a non-specific defensive mechanism around the area of injury, as a result of ae the damage of tissues caused by the injury or an infection Steps of the inflammatory response:   1- When microbes or foreign bodies invade the body tissues, the  inflammation takes place that leads to the occurrence of some here specific cells(like mast cells and basophils) secrete large quantities of inflammatory generating substances and the most important one is histamine(chemical substance)"
238,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"substance) Do you know?   Mast cells: are a type of white blood cells that are found in the loose (proper) connective tissues, especially those found under the skin and around the blood and lymphatic vessels, these cells are characterized by a cytoplasm that is rich in histamine substance that is released, when mast cells are stimulated by the action of the factors causing inflammation or allergy 2- The inflammatory-generating substances (as histamine) work on: - Dilating the blood vessels at the area of injury to the maximum limit - Increasing the permeability of arterioles and blood capillaries to the fluids which leak from the blood circulation, this leads to:    - The swelling of tissues at the site of inflammation - Allowing the passage of chemicals that kill and dissolve bacteria to the site of injury - Enabling the white blood cells as neutrophils and monocytes, as well as the macrophages to fight and kill the foreign bodies and microbes"
239,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"bodies and microbes Note:   There are two other components of the second line of defense that are found in most tissues, which are: - interferon Inflammatory (Non-specific) response:   1- When the skin is cut, bacteria penetrate this wound 2- The presence of bacteria causes the secretion of histamine ssubstance by mast cells at the site of injury 3- Since the histamine granukes cause the dilation of local blood vessels So, the flow of plasma to the site of the injury increases, causing redness, swelling and pain 4- Histamine granules increase permeability of local blood vessels at the injury site and stimulate (activate) the other immune cells 5- White blood cells called neutrophils and monocytes, and macrophages come to the site of infection from the local blood vessels to engulf the bacteria and damaged cells"
240,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"and damaged cells We can summarize that in the following steps:   1- Bacteria enter the body through slashes, stimulating specific cells as the mast cells to secrete histamine substance at the site of injury 2- Histamine granules cause the dilation of blood vessels, so that the flow of plasma to the site of injury increases, causing redness, swelling and pain 3- Neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages are gathered at the site injury, in order to engulf the bacteria and damaged cells Second Acquired (Specific or adaptive) immunity:    If the second line of defense failed in getting rid of the foreign body, the acquired immunity (third line of defense) in the body is activated The third line of defense is represented by the lymphocytes that respond by a series of specific defensive mechanisms that resist the pathogen, and all these defensive mechanisms are called the immune response"
241,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"the immune response Immune response: It is a series of specific (adaptive) defensive mechanisms that is done by the lymphocytes to resist the pathogen Do you know?   The body can distinguish the body cells from the foreign cells that must be fought and destroyed, as the body cells have specialized proteins called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), where the immune system can distinguish and recognize them, while the foreign cells don’t have these proteins, therefore when they invade the body, they activate the two mechanisms of acquired immunity Mechanisms of acquired immunity:   The acquired immunity is done through two apparent separated mechanisms that are actually interconnected with each other, which are:    1- Humoral or antibody-mediated immunity 2- Cellular or cell-mediated immunity"
242,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"immunity We will study each of them in detail as follows:   1-Humoral or antibody-mediated immunity:   Humoral immunity:   It is the immune response through which the B-lymphocytes defend the body against the antigens of pathogens (as bacteria and viruses) and the toxins that are present in the body fluids (blood plasma and lymph) by producing antibodies Steps of humoral immunity:   1- Attachment of B-lymphocytes with antigen:   - When a pathogen enters the body carrying on its surface a specific antigen, the specific B-lymphocyte recognizes this antigen and attached to it by using the immune receptors that are present on its surface - The antigen binds with a protein in the B-lymphocytes that is called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein - Then, the complex resulting from the binding between the antigen and MHC protein transfers to the surface of B-lymphocytes Note: B-lymphocytes are highly specific, as each of them can respond to a single specific antigen"
243,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"specific antigen Note: B-lymphocytes are highly specific, as each of them can respond to a single specific antigen 2- Role of macrophages:   - At the same time, the macrophages engulf the antigen and digest it by their lysosomal enzymes into small fragments - These small fragments bind inside the macrophages to MHC protein - Then, the complex resulting from the binding between the antigen and MHC protein transfers to the surface of plasma membrane of macrophages (to be displayed on its outer surface) 3- Activation of the helper T-cells:   Helper T-cells (TH) will recognize the antigen through the MHC protein that binds with it on the surface of the macrophage - The helper T-cells (TH) bind to the antigen-MHC complex through their receptor CD4 that is present on their surface to be converted into the activated helper T-cells (TH)"
244,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"helper T-cells (TH) - The activated helper T-cells (TH) release protein substances called interleukin that will activate the B-cells which carry the antigens linked with the MHC protein on their surface Note: The helper T-cells (TH) can recognize the antigen only after being treated by the macrophages and displaying it on their plasma membrane linked with the MHC protein molecules 4- Production of antibodies:   The activated B-cells start their work by dividing and multiplying to differentiate at the end into two types of cells:   - Plasma B-cells: produce large amounts of antibodies which circulate through the lymphatic vessels and bloodstream to fight the infection - Memory B-cells: remain in the blood for a long period (20 : 30 years) to recognize the same antigen, if it re-enters the body again, where they divide and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies specific for the same antigen, making a rapid response (faster than the first response to the first infection)"
245,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"first infection) 5- Destruction of pathogens (microbes): The antibodies that are produced by the plasma cells will reach the blood circulation through the lymph, where they bind to the antigens that are found on the surface of pathogens, this will activate the macrophages to re-engulf these antigens once again, and this process continues for several days or weeks Note: The antibodies that are produced by the plasma cells are not effective enough to destroy some foreign cells, such as the infected cells by viruses, as they can’t pass through the cells’ membranes, because these antibodies are relatively large-sized molecules, therefore they can’t reach the virus that reproduces inside the cell In this case, these foreign cells will be combated by the T-lymphocytes"
246,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"the T-lymphocytes Biology in our daily life:   - Vaccine: it is the antigen that is able to stimulate the immunity and unable to cause disease, where it contains the pathogenic microbe in a weak form, and occasionally parts of the microbe’s components or the toxins that are secreted after being treated chemically are taken, in order not to be harmful The vaccine stimulates the body to produce antibodies against the microbe and form an acquired immunity against it, and the immunity resulted from the vaccine is called artificial long-term active immunity So, vaccine is a prevention method against pathogens - The active immunity is considered natural immunity, if it is followed by the infection with the disease itself"
247,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"the disease itself - Serum: it is the ready-made antibodies or antitoxins that are effective as soon as it is taken, this effect lasts for short periods, and the immunity resulted from the injection by serum is called artificial short-term passive immunity that is used in case of the occurrence of an epidemic and there is no much time to acquire an active immunity against the microbe that causes this epidemic So, serum represents a treatment method against pathogens - The mother’s foremilk contains antibodies to provide the baby with a natural short-term immunity 2- Cellular or cell-mediated immunity:   Cellular immunity:   It is the immune response that is done by T-lymphocytes through the receptors which are found on their membranes and provide them a specific response to the antigens"
248,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"to the antigens Steps of cellular immunity:   1-The role of macrophages:   - When the pathogen (bacteria or virus) enters the body, the macrophages will engulf and decompose it (antigen of the pathogen) into small fragments - These small fragments bind inside  the macrophages to MHC protein - The antigen-MHC protein complex will transfer to the plasma membrane surface of macrophages (i it is displayed on their outer surface) Specific response to antigens: Each T-cell produces during its maturation a specific type of receptors which is specialized to its membrane Therefore, each type of these receptors can bind to a single type of antigens 2-Activation of helper T-cells (TH):    - The helper T-cells (TH) will bind through their receptor CD4 that is present on their surface to the antigen-MHC protein complex that is displayed on the surface of macrophages to be converted into the activated helper T-cells"
249,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"helper T-cells - The activated helper T-cells (TH) do the following:   1- Releasing the interleukin proteins that activate (stimulate) the helper T-cells (TH) which are linked with them to divide and form a strain of:   -Activated (TH) cells -Memory (TH) cells that remain in blood for a long period of time to recognize the same antigen, if it re-enters the body again 2- Secreting different types of cytokinesis proteins that:   - Attract the macrophages to the site of infection in large numbers - Stimulate the macrophages, B-lymphocytes and other types of T-lymphocytes (cytotoxic T-cells (TC) and suppressor T-cells (TS) therefore activate both defensive mechanisms (the cellular and humoral immunities) - Activate the natural killer cells (NK) to attack the abnormal body cells like the cancer cells or the cells that are infected by pathogens"
250,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"by pathogens 3- The role of the cytotoxic killer T-cells (TC):   The cytotoxic T-cells (TC) can recognize the foreign bodies through the receptor CD8 that is found on their surfaces, whether these foreign bodies are transplanted tissues in the body or antigens of microbes that enter the body or cancer cells, and bind to them, then destroy them by secreting:   - perform protein (perforating protein) that perforates the membrane of the foreign body (microbes or cancer cells) - Lymphatic toxins that activate certain genes in the nucleus of the infected cells, leading to the destruction of the cell nucleus and its death Inhibition of the immune response:   After destroying the antigens, the suppressor T-cells (TS) bind through the receptor CD8 that is found on their surfaces to the plasma B-cells, helper T-cells (TH) and cytotoxic T-cells (TC), stimulating the suppressor T-cells to secrete proteins called lymphokines which suppress or inhibit the immune response"
251,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"the immune response This leads to:   - Stopping the production of antibodies from the plasma B-cells - The death of many activated helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells Note: After inhibiting the immune response, some lymphocytes (plasma B-cells, helper T-cells TH and cytotoxic T-cells TC) are stored in the lymphoid organs to be ready to combat any similar infection when needed Key Points:   -The most specialized white blood cells are the lymphocytes, and the most specialized lymphocytes are the B-cells -Phagocytic immune cells : - Macrophages - Cells that display the antigens on their surface : - B-lymphocytes -Types of immune receptors on the surface of T-cells :    CD4 on the surface of TH Stages of acquired immunity:   - Acquired immunity passes through two stages, which are:   First Stage : primary immune response:   - It is the immune system response to a new pathogen"
252,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"to a new pathogen - B and T-cells are responsible for the primary immune response, where they respond to the antigens of the pathogen and attack them till destroying them - It is a slow response, as it takes between (5 :10) days to reach its maximum productivity of B and T-cells that need time to multiply - It is accompanied by the appearance of disease symptoms, because the infection becomes widespread in the body - Both types of memory cells (B & T) are produced, but remain inactive in blood Second Stage:Secondary immune response:   - It is the immune system response to the same pathogen that has been infected the body before - Memory cells are responsible for the secondary immune response, because they store information about the antigens that had been fought by the immune system in the past - It is a very fast response, as the pathogen is often destroyed before the appearance of the symptoms"
253,Immunity in Living Organisms,The Immune System Mechanism in Man,"of the symptoms - It is not accompanied by the appearance of the disease symptoms, because the pathogen is destroyed quickly -It activates the memory cells that are formed previously in the primary immune response Key Points: - The period in which the memory B-lymphocytes remain in blood From 20 : 30 years - The time that is taken by the primary immune response Ranging from 5: 10 days - The explanation of primary and secondary immune responses through the following graph as follows:- In period (A to B) : B-cells, helper T-cells and plasma B-cells are activated, and the formation of memory cells and antibodies begins - In period (B to C) : suppressor T-cells are activated, and the secretion of lymphokines occurs - In period (D to E) : the memory cells respond and get activated rapidly, and the antibodies are formed Memory cells: A type of cells that store information about the antigens that had been fought by the immune system in the past"

Labelling the element means converting this element from the stable form into the radioactive form to be easily detected We conclude from the bacterial transformation experiments and the experiments that carried out on phages that the genes of pneumonia bacterial strains and phages are composed of DNA And notice that these conclusions are restricted on the living organisms on which these experiments were carried out"
272,DNA and Genetic Information,Efforts of the Scientists to Determine the Genetic Material of Living Organisms,"were carried out The question now, are all genes composed of DNA?   The answer is NO, because there are some viruses (as HIV virus that causes AIDS and influenza virus) whose genetic material is RNA not DNA, and it was proven that these viruses are exceptions of the rule, as they represent a small percentage of the forms of life, but all the various studies that are carried out till now confirmed that DNA is the genetic material in almost all the forms of life 3- Amount of DNA in the cells:   DNA amount in cells is considered as a substantial evidence that DNA is the genetic material, as on measuring the amount of DNA in eukaryotes, we found that:   - The amount of DNA in different kinds of somatic cells of a certain living organism (as chicken) is equal, while the amount of proteins in the same cells is unequal - The amount of DNA in the reproductive cells (gametes) equals half the amount of DNA in the somatic cells of the same living organism"

296,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"arginine and lysine The histone proteins bind strongly with the negatively charged phosphate groups that are present in DNA molecule, because the terminal alkyl group (R) of the two amino acids (arginine and lysine) has a positive charge at the normal pH of the cell 2- Non-histone proteins:   Non-histones: They are heterogeneous group of structural and regulatory proteins that are found in the structure of the cell chromatin Non-histone proteins have many different functions, because they include:   - Structural proteins: enter in the structure of some definite parts of DNA molecule and play a main role in the spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus - Regulatory proteins: determine whether the DNA code will be used in synthesizing RNA, proteins and enzymes or not"
297,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"and enzymes or not Packaging of DNA:   If we imagine that the DNA double helix molecule of each chromosome was unwounded, then lined up and stretched out, and these molecules were placed along each other, it would be about 2 meters in length Therefore, the histones and other proteins are responsible for packaging this long molecules to fit into the cell’s nucleus that is 2 : 3 micron in diameter Steps of DNA packaging:   Biochemical analysis and electron micrograph had shown that DNA is packed, as follows:   1- DNA molecule is wounded around clusters of histone proteins, forming a string of particles that are called nucleosomes This shortens the DNA molecule about tenfold, but it must be packed about 100000 times more tightly to fit into the nucleus Nucleosomes: They are string of particles found in the chromosomes and consist of DNA molecule wounded (wrapped) around clusters of histones to shorten the DNA molecule about tenfold"
298,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"about tenfold 2- The strings of nucleosomes are coiled again to pack the nucleosomes together However, even this is not sufficient to shorten the DNA molecule to the required length 3- The tightly coiled strings of nucleosides are arranged in large loops that are held together by the structural non-histone proteins to form chromatin 4- The chromatin is coiled and condensed tightly forming condensed chromatin Note:   When DNA molecule is packed in the form of chromatin, replication enzymes apparently can’t reach it This packaging must be unwounded at least into a string of nucleosides, before DNA can serve as a template for DNA or RNA synthesis"
299,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"or RNA synthesis Key Point:   DNA packaging in eukaryotes:   DNA + Histone protein gives Nucleosomes + Structural non-histone gives chromatin   From the previous we can compare between histone proteins and non-histone proteins, as follows:   Histone proteins:   - Definition: Well-defined group of small structural proteins which are present in great amounts in the chromatin of any cell, where they have a high content of the two basic amino acids arginine and lysine - Function:   1- They bind strongly to the negatively charged phosphate groups that are found in DNA molecule, as at the normal pH of the cell, the two amino acids (arginine and lysine) have positively charged terminal alkyl groups (R) 2- They are responsible for shortening the DNA molecule tenfold by forming a string of nucleosomes Non-histone proteins:   - Definition: Heterogeneous group of structural and regulatory proteins that enter in the structure of chromatin"
300,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"of chromatin - Function:   1- Structural proteins: play a main role in the spatial organization of DNA molecule within the nucleus, as they are responsible for shortening DNA molecule about 100,000 times by forming the condensed chromatin 2- Regulatory proteins: determine  whether the DNA code will be used in synthesizing RNA,  proteins and enzymes or not Structure of the genome:   In 1977, the researchers found methods that can be used for determining the sequences of nucleotides in DNA and RNA molecules This led to determining the genes arrangement within the cell’s DNA molecules Genome: The total of all genes (all DNA) that are found in the cell DNA contains genes that carry the instructions needed to transcribe the:   1- Sequence of nucleotides that is responsible for synthesizing protein compounds 2- Sequence of nucleotides which enters in the building of ribosomes (ribosomal RNA (rRNA))"

308,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"cultivated plants So, the farmer considered it as a desired trait and took care of breeding these mutant sheep Third According to the type of mutation:   1- Gene mutations:   - Mutations occur as a result of a chemical change in the gene structure, especially the change in the arrangement of the nitrogenous bases in DNA molecule, that leads to the production of a different protein which in turn develops a new trait - The change in the chemical structure of the gene may be accompanied by a change from a dominant gene to a recessive gene and the opposite may occur in some rare cases Do you know?   The case of albinism is from the examples for the gene mutations in human, and it results from the occurrence of change in the structure of skin colour gene, leading to the non-formation of melanin pigment protein 2- Chromosomal mutations: Mutations occur as a result of a change in the number or structure of chromosomes"
309,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"of chromosomes A- Change in the number of chromosomes:   It means a decrease or an increase in one chromosome or more in the gametes after the meiotic division - Increase in the number of chromosomes: As in Klinefelter’s syndrome (44 + XXY), where there is an extra sex chromosome (X) - Decrease in the number of chromosomes: As in Turner’s syndrome (44 + X), where there is a less sex chromosome (X) 3- Duplication of the chromosomes number (Polyploidy):   Its causes:   - The non-separation of the chromatids after the centromere division - The non-formation of the separating membrane between the two daughter cells Its commonness and effect:   - In plants:    It is more common, where a large proportion of the known plants are (3n, 4n, 6n, 8n, up to 16n), when the chromosomes are duplicated in the gametes This results in the production of individuals with new characters, because each gene is represented by greater number of copies, thus its effect becomes more pronounced"
310,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"more pronounced So, the plant becomes taller and consequently its organs become bigger, especially the flowers and fruits Example: nowadays, there are many tetraploid (4n) crops and fruits, such as cotton, wheat, apples, grapes, pears and strawberries In animals:   it is less common (rare), because the sex determination in animals demands the presence of a dedicated balance between the numbers of autosomes and sex chromosomes Thus, the presence of polyploid in animals is restricted to some hermaphrodite snails and worms, where the sex determination problem doesn’t exist In man:   triploidy in man is found to be lethal and causes the miscarriage, however polyploid may occur in some liver and pancreas cells in man"
311,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"cells in man B- Change in the structure of chromosome:   It occurs as a result of a change in the arrangement of genes on the same chromosome, because of:   - The separation of a piece from the chromosome during the cell division, its rotation around itself 180° and its rejoining to the same chromosome again, but in an inverted position - The exchange of segments from non-homologous chromosomes - The increase (insertion or duplication) or decrease (deletion) of a small piece from the chromosome Remember that: Exchanging some segments between the homologous chromosomes during meiosis, is known as crossing over which may lead to a variation in the genetic traits Fourth According to the position of mutation:   1- Gamete mutation:   - It occurs in the reproductive cells (gametes) - It appears as new traits in the resulted embryo - It occurs in the living organisms that reproduce sexually 2- Somatic mutation:   - It occurs in the somatic cells"

313,DNA and Genetic Information,DNA in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes,"and Nitrous acid When plants are treated with these substances, the growing tip cells of the plants are atrophied and died, where new tissues are regenerated underneath these dead cells whose cells have polyploid Most of the induced mutations produce undesirable traits, but man selects the useful ones from them Do you know?   Colchicine substance prevents the formation of spindle fibres that are necessary for chromosomes splitting during anaphase in meiosis (I) So, polyploidy happens in the produced cells From the examples of the desirable induced mutations:   1- Induced mutations that lead to the production of fruit trees with more sweet taste and seedless big fruits artificial parthenocarpy 2- Induced mutations in micro-organisms, such as Penicillium which is capable of producing large quantities of antibiotics (such as penicillin)"

318,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"Types of proteins:   Thousand types of proteins enter in the structure of the body of living organisms and can be divided into two main groups, which are:   1- Structural proteins:   They are proteins that enter in certain structures in the living organisms Examples:    - Actin and myosin (Fibrous Proteins): enter in the structure of muscles and other contractile organs - Collagen: enters in the structure of some connective tissues in the body (ligaments and tendons) - Keratin: forms the protective coverings, such as skin, hair, hooves, feathers and others 2- Regulatory proteins:   They are proteins that regulate numerous processes and vital activities in the living organisms Examples:   - Enzymes: catalyze the chemical reactions in the body of living organisms - Antibodies: provide the body with immunity against foreign bodies"
319,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,foreign bodies - Hormones and other substances: Enable the living organism to respond appropriately to the continuously changing internal and external environments of the body Protein construction:   - There is a common plan for constructing thousand kinds of proteins that are found in the living systems (living organisms’ bodies) - The protein is composed of 20 types of amino acids that have the same basic structure Structure of amino acid:   The first carbon atom (α-carbon) in the amino acid is attached to:   Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom (C) bonded to four different groups:   Carboxyl group (-COOH): Positioned to the right of the central carbon Amino group (-NH₂): Positioned below the central carbon Alkyl group (R group): Positioned to the left of the central carbon This group varies among different amino acids Hydrogen atom (H): Positioned above the central carbon Amino acid: It is the basic building unit of protein

323,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"into mRNA - The two strands of DNA are separated from each other, where one strand of them acts as a template for the synthesis of mRNA in the direction (3 to 5 ) of template strand and the RNA-polymerase enzyme synthesizes the mRNA in the direction (5 to 3) - RNA-polymerase enzyme moves along the DNA molecule, where it joins the complementary ribonucleotides to the growing mana strand one by one This process is much similar to the replication process of DNA, except that:   - DNA replication once begun, it usually replicates all the DNA in the cell, while in case of RNA synthesis, it transcribes only a selected portion of the DNA (that carries the gene) - Since DNA molecule is double-stranded, theoretically any part of DNA could be transcribed into two different ran molecules, each one of them is complementary to one of the two strands"
324,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"of the two strands But practically, the transcription of RNA occurs through only one of the two DNA strands which is used to transcribe a segment of this strand into RNA, as the orientation of the promoter indicates the strand that will be transcribed Transcription and translation processes of mRNA in prokaryotes differ from those in eukaryotes, as follows:   1- In prokaryotes:   - Transcription: There is a single RNA-polymerase enzyme that transcribes the three types of RNA (mRNA, rRNA and tRNA) - Translation: The mRNA is ready for being translated into the corresponding protein, during its transcription from DNA, where the ribosomes bind to the beginning of the mRNA and start to translate it into protein, while the other end of mRNA is still being synthesized from the DNA template 2- In eukaryotes:   - Transcription: There are three different kinds of RNA-polymerase enzyme, where each type is responsible for transcribing a specific RNA molecule"
325,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"RNA molecule - Translation: Translation of mRNA into the corresponding protein doesn’t occur, until the whole mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, then the mature mRNA transfers to the cytoplasm through the pores of the nuclear membrane Structure of mRNA molecule:   - At the beginning of mRNA molecule: there is a ribosome binding site which is a sequence of nucleotides that bind to the ribosome, where the first codon start codon (AUG) is positioned correctly upward for translation - At the end of mRNA molecule there are:   1- Stop codon: maybe one of three codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) 2- Polyadenine tail (Poly-A):   It is composed of about 200 adenosine and it is non-coding Its function: it protects mRNA from being hydrolyzed by the enzymes that are found in the cytoplasm 2- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA):   - Function of rRNA: Four different types of rRNA and about 70 kinds of polypeptides contribute in the synthesis of the ribosomes (organelles of protein synthesis in the cell)"

327,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"starts again The proteins that enter in the structure of ribosomes are made in the cytoplasm, then pass through the nuclear envelope and enter the nucleus, where each of rRNA and polypeptides are assembled into the two ribosomal subunits During the protein synthesis process, an interaction occurs between the mRNA and rRNA Key Point:   Ribosomes:   - Their chemical structure: 70 types of polypeptide chains + 4 types of rRNA - Their functional structure:   Small ribosomal subunit Large ribosomal subunit that contains:   - peptide site (P) 3- Transfer RNA (tRNA):   - Function of tRNA:   During protein synthesis, the tRNA carries the amino acids to the ribosomes, where for each amino acid, there is a specific kind of tRNA molecule that will recognize it, then transport it, but the amino acids that have more than one codon, have more than one kind of tRNA So, the number of tRNA molecules is more than 20"
328,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"is more than 20 - Transcription of tRNA: The tRNA is transcribed from the tRNA genes that are present on DNA in the form of clusters of seven or eight tRNA genes on the same part of DNA molecule - General structure of tRNA molecule:   All tRNA molecules have the same general shape, where the parts of the molecule are folded back to form characteristic loops which are held in shape (maintain their shape) by base-pairing at different areas of the molecule There are two sites on tRNA molecule which have a role in the protein synthesis:   The first:   the site of amino acid attachment with the molecule, this site consists of three bases (CCA) at the (3) end of the molecule The second:   the anticodon site whose bases are paired with the appropriate mRNA codons at the mRNA ribosome complex, where a temporary binding occurs between the tRNA and the mRNA, allowing the amino acid that is carried by the tRNA to be incorporated into the polypeptide chain in its proper place"

The first amino acid (methionine) will be removed later during the translation process The synthesis of protein takes place through three main steps, as follows:   First Initiation of translation process:   1- The mRNA molecule binds to the small ribosomal subunit from the (5) end, where the first codon (AUG) is positioned correctly upward 2- The AUG codon paired with the anticodon bases of tRNA molecule carrying methionine which becomes the first amino acid in the polypeptide chain that will be built 3- The large ribosomal subunit binds to the previous complex (small ribosomal subunit + mRNA + tRNA) and the reactions of protein synthesis begin Notes:   - The large ribosomal subunit has two sites (peptidyl site P and aminoacyl site A), where tRNA molecules can bind"
334,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,RNA and Protein Synthesis,"molecules can bind - Methionine is the first amino acid in the polypeptide chain, because the initiation codon on the mRNA is (AUG) which represents the code for methionine amino acid that found at the peptide site (P) Second Polypeptide elongation:   The polypeptide chain elongates in a cycle of three steps:   1- The anticodon of another tRNA binds to the next codon on the mRNA molecule in the aminoacyl site (A), carrying the second amino acid in the polypeptide chain 2-   - The peptidyl transferase reaction takes place which results in the formation of a peptide bond between the first and second amino acids by the help of peptidyl transferase enzyme that is an integral part of the large ribosomal subunit - The first tRNA becomes empty and leaves the ribosome, and it may pick up another methionine, while the second tRNA is holding the both amino acids"

347,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,Molecular Technology(Genetic Engineering),"between them - The degree of annealing between any two strands depends on how far their nitrogenous bases’ sequences are complementary to each other, and this can be measured by the amount of heat required to separate them again The more the strands are bonded tightly together, the more amount of heat will be required to separate them (i there is a higher degree of complementarity between the nitrogenous bases) - The ability of the single-stranded DNA or RNA to anneal can be used to produce hybrid or mixed double helices How to form a hybrid DNA:   Steps of the production of hybrid DNA double helix:   1- Nucleic acids from two different sources (for instance from two different species of living organisms) are mixed 2- Heating them to 100°C, therefore the DNA molecules are separated into single strands"
348,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,Molecular Technology(Genetic Engineering),"into single strands 3- When the mixture is allowed to cool, the pairing of the complementary nitrogenous bases between the strands takes place, so that some of the original helices are formed, in addition to a number of hybrid double-stranded helices (hybrid DNA) will be formed, where each helix is made up of one strand from each source Hybrid DNA:   A double helix formed of two strands, one of them is from a living organism and its complementary strand is from another living organism DNA Hybridization Process:   Starting Material:   DNA from Source A:   Strand 1: T G A C A T G   Strand 2: A C T G T A C   DNA from Source B:   Strand 1: A T G C G T A   Strand 2: T A C G C A T   Denaturation: The DNA samples from both sources are heated to 100°C This causes the double-stranded DNA to separate into single strands Cooling and Reannealing: The single strands are then cooled, allowing them to re-pair Two outcomes are possible:   - Original (Pure) DNA re-forms from matching original strands"

Because the bacteria that contain restriction enzymes form modification enzymes which recognize those particular sequences and add a methyl group (CH3) to the nucleotides on the sites of bacterial DNA molecule which are similar to the recognition sites on the viral DNA, which makes the bacterial DNA more resistant to the action of these restriction enzymes, therefore the bacterial cell protects its genetic material (DNA) from breaking down by the action of restriction enzymes Mechanism of the restriction enzymes action:   1- Each restriction enzyme recognizes a specific sequence of four to seven nucleotides in the two DNA strands which is known as the recognition site"
352,Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis,Molecular Technology(Genetic Engineering),"recognition site 2- The enzyme cuts the DNA molecule at or near this recognition site, where the sequence of nitrogenous bases on the two strands of DNA at the recognition site is the same, when the sequence is read on each strand in the (5 to 3) direction Each restriction enzyme has the ability to cleave the DNA molecule regardless its source (viral, bacterial, plant or animal), as long as this part of DNA contains one or more copies of its specific recognition site Recognition site:   A specific sequence of four to seven nucleotides on the two DNA strands which is recognized by the restriction enzyme, then the enzyme cuts the molecule of DNA at or near this site, and the sequence of nitrogenous bases on one strand is the same on the other strand (5 to 3) Importance of the restriction enzymes:   - Restriction endonucleases provide a way to cut the DNA molecule into pieces with known nucleotides at their ends"
